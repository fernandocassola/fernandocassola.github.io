I"î<p>Jekyll is a simple, blog-aware, static site generator for personal, project, or organization sites. Written in Ruby by Tom Preston-Werner, GitHubâ€™s co-founder, it is distributed under the open source MIT license.</p>

<p>Jekyll renders Markdown or Textile and Liquid templates,[7] and produces a complete, static website ready to be served by Apache HTTP Server, Nginx or another web server.[8] As Jekyll is a static site generator, it does not uses databases[9] to generate the pages dynamically. Instead of using databases, Jekyll supports loading content from YAML, JSON, CSV, and TSV files.[10] Content inside the Data Files(YAML, JSON, CSV and TSV files) can be accessed via Liquid templating system.[11] Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages,[12] a GitHub feature that allows users to host websites based on their GitHub repositories for no additional cost.</p>

<p>Jekyll can be used in combination with front-end frameworks such as Bootstrap,[13] Semantic UI and many others.</p>

<p>Jekyll sites can be connected to cloud-based CMS software such as CloudCannon, Forestry, Netlify or Siteleaf, enabling content editors to modify site content without having to know how to code.</p>
